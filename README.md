# Simple-Todo-List
A simple to-do list in less than 50 lines of code with Vanilla JavaScript.

I got inspiration for this to-do list project from Fireship.io's video on 10 apps with 10 frameworks, where he created 10 to-do list projects in Vanilla JavaScript and 9 more
frameworks.

You can copy this code and use it for personal uses, but for commercial use, or anything you are not sure of, contact me at off.davidgeorge@gmail.com.
